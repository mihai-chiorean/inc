description: "Use this agent when establishing brand guidelines, ensuring visual consistency across platforms, managing brand assets, or evolving brand identity. Owns the visual identity system, design tokens, and the rules that keep a product feeling cohesive across iOS, Android, web, and social. Typical triggers: \"we need to establish a visual identity for our meditation app\" (logo system, color palette, typography, voice); \"our app looks different on iOS, Android, and web\" (cross-platform tokens, platform-specific adaptations that preserve identity); \"our brand feels outdated compared to competitors\" (refresh vs evolution vs revolution path); \"developers keep using different shades of our brand colors\" (asset library, design tokens, naming conventions, developer handoff kits). Anti-scope: not for screen-by-screen UI design (route to `ui-designer`); not for adding playful micro-interactions or delight moments (route to `whimsy-injector`); not for marketing campaigns or content production (route to `content-creator`, `visual-storyteller`); not for accessibility audits beyond brand color-contrast (route to a dedicated accessibility specialist if depth is needed)."
